/**
  The ActiveModelSerializer is a subclass of the RESTSerializer designed to integrate
  with a JSON API that uses an underscored naming convention instead of camelCasing.
  It has been designed to work out of the box with the
  [active\_model\_serializers](http://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers)
  Ruby gem. This Serializer expects specific settings using ActiveModel::Serializers,
  `embed :ids, embed_in_root: true` which sideloads the records.

  This serializer extends the DS.RESTSerializer by making consistent
  use of the camelization, decamelization and pluralization methods to
  normalize the serialized JSON into a format that is compatible with
  a conventional Rails backend and Ember Data.

  ## JSON Structure

  The ActiveModelSerializer expects the JSON returned from your server
  to follow the REST adapter conventions substituting underscored keys
  for camelcased ones.

  ### Conventional Names

  Attribute names in your JSON payload should be the underscored versions of
  the attributes in your Ember.js models.

  For example, if you have a `Person` model:

  ```js
  App.FamousPerson = DS.Model.extend({
    firstName: DS.attr('string'),
    lastName: DS.attr('string'),
    occupation: DS.attr('string')
  });
  ```

  The JSON returned should look like this:

  ```js
  {
    "famous_person": {
      "id": 1,
      "first_name": "Barack",
      "last_name": "Obama",
      "occupation": "President"
    }
  }
  ```

  Let's imagine that `Occupation` is just another model:

  ```js
  App.Person = DS.Model.extend({
    firstName: DS.attr('string'),
    lastName: DS.attr('string'),
    occupation: DS.belongsTo('occupation')
  });

  App.Occupation = DS.Model.extend({
    name: DS.attr('string'),
    salary: DS.attr('number'),
    people: DS.hasMany('person')
  });
  ```

  The JSON needed to avoid extra server calls, should look like this:

  ```js
  {
    "people": [{
      "id": 1,
      "first_name": "Barack",
      "last_name": "Obama",
      "occupation_id": 1
    }],

    "occupations": [{
      "id": 1,
      "name": "President",
      "salary": 100000,
      "person_ids": [1]
    }]
  }
  ```

        }
      }
